# CEA_vs_BLOCK_vs_OBA

1.0	Introduction:
1.1     Background and Rationale:  Scoliosis is the most common spinal disorder in children.  It may be idiopathic or secondary to congenital or neuromuscular causes.   Scoliosis correction surgery (SCS) is a frequently performed procedure to correct the spinal deformity.  SCS is a painful procedure often associated with substantial opioid use in the postoperative period and beyond.  Opioid medications in the postoperative period have been associated with perioperative complications. (1)  Several studies with small sample sizes have suggested that continuous epidural analgesia (CEA) may provide decreased opioid requirements and improved analgesia compared to opioid based analgesia (OBA) in SCS patients.(2,3,4)  However, several studies have found no difference in pain scores and opioid use with or without CEA (5,6,7).   A recent study reported that 98% of SCS patients with OBA used opioids during their hospitalization after SCS. (8)  In our experience with CEA for SCS we have observed that approximately 40% of patients with CEA require opioids at some time while the epidural was in place. 

The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that CEA for SCS decreases opioid usage postoperatively.  The primary endpoint is the rate of opioid usage in the two treatment groups through discharge.   Secondary end-points are opioid usage (oral morphine equivalent mg/kg) and pain scores while the epidural is in place and the day the epidural is removed, complication rates during the hospitalization and the length of stay in both groups. Additionally, we will compare opioid usage within OBA treatment groups that use similar non-opioid analgesic agents but at different doses.  Complications will be defined based on ICD-9 diagnosis coding of a disease or disorder not present at admission, which as a consequence of the surgical procedure, negatively affected the outcome of the patient, or inferred by significant empirical evidence suggestive of known complications, such as multiple and repeated dosing with commonly-used counteracting medications.   We have a priori defined a 25% reduction in the complication rate as clinically significant.    

The study design will be a retrospective cohort study employing Business Objects (BO), a software application currently in use throughout the Shriners Children’s system. BO provides data reporting via query and analysis of the Shriners Children’s Shriners Hospitals for Children Information System (SHCIS) database, (the EMR).     
 
1.2	Risk/Benefits
1.2.1	Risk Category: Minimal Risk 

1.2.2	The primary risks for this study relate to privacy and confidentiality. The probability of a security breach is lessened with the use of password protected computer systems requiring a login. Risk will be minimized with the close adherence to HIPAA guidelines to help prevent a breach in security.     

1.2.3	As this is a retrospective study design, there is no potential direct benefit to the subjects and no alternative to participation.  
2.0	Objectives:
2.1	The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that CEA for posterior spinal fusion decreases opioid usage compared to OBA while the epidural is in place.

2.2	The secondary objectives of this study are to 
2.2.1	Determine if there is a clinically significant difference in the two treatment groups for 1. Complication rate (a priori 25% reduction), 2. Length of stay (LOS), 3. Pain scores (i.e. Verbal Analog Pain Score (VAPS)).
2.2.2	Efficacy of differing dosing schemes between similar OBA protocols.
 
2.3	Rationale for selection of outcome measures:  Opioid use in the postoperative period has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of complications after surgery. Complications after posterior spinal fusion are an important measure of morbidity and mortality after posterior spinal fusion, and length of stay is an important determinant of hospital cost.

3.0	Subject Selection: 
3.1	Inclusion Criteria:  All patients ages 9 – 21 years of age who had a primary            scoliosis correction surgery in the form of posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation during the time period between 01/01/2011 to 11/5/2021 at a Shriners Hospital for Children facility. 
3.2	Exclusion Criteria:  
3.2.1	Patients who did not have a primary posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation scoliosis surgery (i.e., repeat operation for infection, revision of hardware, anterior spinal fusion, discectomy, etc.). 
3.2.2	Patients having additional procedures not related to the spine surgery. 
3.2.3	Patients who had a cervical fusion or an isolated lumbar spine fusion of three or fewer segments. 
3.2.4	Patients admitted to inpatient units three or more days prior to undergoing spine fusion surgery.
3.3	Inclusion of Gender, Minorities and vulnerable populations 
3.3.1	The study population will be a consecutive case review, including all eligible pediatric patients of both genders, all ethnic backgrounds, and females of childbearing potential. 
3.3.2	As this is a retrospective study design, pregnant females would not be automatically excluded as a review of their medical records does not pose a safety risk to the subject or the fetus. 
4.0	Study Design/ Procedures:
4.1	General Design
4.1.1	The type/design of the study is a retrospective cohort study of children ages 9 - 21 years of age who have had SCS at a Shriners Hospital for Children location between 01/01/2011 to 11/5/2021.  Patient data will be divided into 2 cohorts; those who received continuous epidural anesthesia (CEA) for postoperative pain control and those whose postoperative pain control did not include epidural analgesia and was opioid based (OBA). We will compare opioid usage (yes/no) and amounts (oral morphine equivalents/kg) while the epidural is in place and after the epidural is removed. Opioid medications include, but are not limited to, morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and tramadol.   We will also compare the complication rate and length of stay between the 2 groups after adjusting for covariates.  We are defining a 25% reduction in complication rate as a clinically significant reduction. Within the OBA cohort, we will look for patients treated with non-opioid analgesic protocols of similar agents but varying dosing schemes.  Non-opioid analgesics will include, but are not limited to, acetaminophen, non-steroidal analgesics (NSAIDs), gabapentinoids, and muscle relaxants.  Methadone, though an opioid, will be considered separate from other opioid agents and count as a unique non-opioid analgesic when comparing OBA protocols.  We will compare these OBA dosing variations for amount of opioid consumed.  

4.1.2	The study population will be a consecutive case review, including all patients meeting inclusion criteria to minimize bias.  
 
4.2	Study Procedures
4.2.1	Upon study approval, a query of the SCHIS database by BO will select SHC patients who underwent SCS from 01/01/2011 to 11/5/2021. Patient identifiers (PHI) may be necessary to link patent information found in the medial record to the correct patient.  The use of patient identifiers will be kept at the minimum necessary to complete the study.  
4.2.2	Data from patients who underwent a primary SCS between 01/01/2011 and 11/5/2021 will be included in the study.
4.2.3	A complete list of data elements is found in section 5.2.2. Data elements requested include the number of patients meeting inclusion criteria, age (years), gender, race, ethnicity, and care center location. Additional data elements required to address the study objectives will include, but are not limited to: diagnosis, secondary diagnosis or co-morbidities, surgical procedure(s), and the placement of an epidural catheter. We will determine the rate of opioid use (yes/no), amount of opioids (oral morphine equivalents) and pain scores while the epidural is in place and after the epidural is removed through discharge.  We will determine the number and category of postoperative complications and compare the length of stay in days, defined as the day of admission until the day of discharge.  
4.2.4	Requested data will be sent to the investigators in the standard format for further statistical analysis.
4.2.5	Data will be analyzed as described in the Statistical Methods section and results will be submitted in the form of a manuscript to appropriate medical publications.
4.3	 Subject Selection
4.3.1	The investigators and study staff members will not know the individual identities of the subjects included in the study unless required to resolve discrepancies, including resolution of null and/or absurd values.  Only the minimum necessary PHI required to complete the study will be obtained. 
4.3.2	Business Objects will be used to find eligible subject data from SCHIS for inclusion in the study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria described in section 3.0.

4.4	Waiver of informed consent and a Waiver of HIPAA authorization will be requested from the IRB. 
4.4.1	This research cannot be practicably carried out without these waivers. The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects. 
4.4.2	The research is not FDA regulated. 
4.4.3	For limited data sets (contains some identifiable data, e.g. dates, etc.):
The waivers will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects as the data will not be reused or disclosed to (1) any other person or entity, except as required by law, for authorized oversight of the research, or (2) for other research for which the use or disclosure of the protected health information would be permitted.

6.0	Statistical Considerations
6.1	Study Endpoints
6.1.1	Primary Study Endpoints: The primary endpoint of the study is opioid use after posterior spinal fusion in groups CEA and OBA while the epidural is in place.  (yes/no and oral morphine equivalents mg/kg)
6.1.2	Secondary Study Endpoints, if any:  
6.1.2.1	The complication rate, length of stay and pain scores in the two treatment groups.  The complication rate will be calculated as the number of patients having a complication divided by the total number of patients in the treatment group.
6.1.2.2	OME/kg use in OBE cohorts of similar non-analgesic protocol but differing dosing schemes.  
6.2	Statistical Methods:   We plan to conduct a multiple regression analysis to understand the influence of epidural analgesia on postoperative opioid use following posterior spinal fusion.  Other outcomes considered will be the rate of complications and the length of stay after adjusting for covariates, including age, gender, comorbidities and surgical procedure.
6.3	Sample Size Determination and Power/Accrual Rate 
In our experience with continuous epidural anesthesia for SCS, we estimate that 60% of patients do not use opioids during the first 3 days after surgery while the epidural is in place (day of surgery, postoperative day 1 and postoperative day 2).  With a sample size of 5,000 in the non-epidural group (98% anticipated to use opioids) and 1,000 in the epidural group (60% anticipated to not use opioids), we determined a power of 0.92 to detect a 25% reduction in the complication rate given rate of complications in the non-epidural group of 17%.(8)
